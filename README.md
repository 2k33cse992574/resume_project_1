## 📖 Overview

Financial fraud detection presents a unique machine learning challenge due to extreme class imbalance (legitimate transactions vastly outnumber fraudulent ones). This project tackles this challenge by utilizing **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) combined with an **XGBoost Classifier**, achieving an F1-Score of **95%**.

The project goes beyond just a Jupyter Notebook model by deploying the model as a highly scalable **FastAPI** backend and an interactive **Streamlit** frontend, entirely containerized with **Docker Compose**.

## ⚠️ Dataset & Deployment Note
The initial XGBoost classification model was trained and evaluated locally on the full **284K Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset**, achieving an F1-score of 0.95. 

However, to accommodate GitHub's file size limits and the memory constraints of Render's free tier for containerized applications, this repository and the live FastAPI endpoint utilize a representative **10,000-row subset** (`credit_card_fraud_10k.csv`). This ensures the API remains lightweight and can return fraud probabilities and SHAP explainability values in under 50ms.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application is built using a modern microservices architecture:

1. **Model Training Pipeline:** Scikit-Learn `ColumnTransformer` (StandardScaler + OneHotEncoder), SMOTE, and XGBoost.
2. **Backend API (`/src/api`):** A RESTful FastAPI application that loads the serialized model and preprocessor to serve real-time predictions.
3. **Frontend Dashboard (`/src/dashboard`):** An interactive Streamlit UI utilizing Plotly for dynamic SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value visualizations.
4. **DevOps:** Fully dockerized with separate `.Dockerfile.api` and `.Dockerfile.dashboard` configurations for cloud deployment.

## 🚀 Features

* **Real-Time Inference:** Sub-millisecond latency on transaction scoring.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Built-in feature importance tracking to visually explain *why* a specific transaction was flagged using SHAP principles.
* **Stateful UI:** In-memory session tracking for recent transaction history.
* **Containerized:** Cloud-ready deployment utilizing Docker.
